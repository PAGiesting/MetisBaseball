#### Plan: Baseball stats & drug use or other factors over time

#### Backup: BeerAdvocate: predict rating from darkness, hoppiness, alcohol, and categorical factors (hops, geography, brewery)

Holy Week: practice scraping both websites. (That's penitential.)

Octave of Easter: perform regressions, glean insights, presentation

##### Baseball ideas:

* Influence of teammates (peers) on batting or pitching performance
* Age
* Focus on fast players in the 80s vs other decades
* Or on the early vs. late 60s. Start with comparing 1962 to 1968. Extend this to finding other years where pitching or hitting (or speed, or fielding) dominates:
  * WAR for pitchers
  * WAR for hitters
  * Runs scored, etc.
  * Stolen bases, doubles, triples
    * Caught stealing... the league's catchers start training to offset speed... pitchers, etc.
  * "Internal" relationships between statistics within a category (pitching hitting, speed, fielding).
  * "External" relationships between statistics of differing categories.
    * Internal work identifies best banner-bearer statistics for this comparison work.
  * Which ones have the largest contribution to games won for teams in varying years?
  * 1962 is a good year to start because it's the first 162 game season.
  * Predict games won, run for & against...
  * Can I cast retrospective odds for winning WS and map this back onto playoffs?
    * Discuss the "playoffs = crapshoot" hypothesis
* Use polynomials up to degree 2 or 3 & look for leveling off between parameters

### Presentation outline

Intro: Cardinals fan. Baseball has lots of countable (and counted) things.

Cardinals teams & Year of the Pitcher 1967-68, 1980s speed, 1998 hitters / home runs

Earl Weaver home run teams vs. Whitey Herzog manufactured runs teams



Conclusion: Slice data by trends of 2-10 years & look for predictors of what side of the game will dominate.

Long term trends: are pitchers pitching less innings?

Hindcast various peak years.

Marketing angle: Shape team's, league's, game's image around the right category of player. Cardinals player examples.

Appendix: Real data.

Jokes: Don't root for the Yankees.

Bob Gibson & Tim McCarver.

Vince Coleman and his tarp.

Roid rage shot into Big Mac Land.
